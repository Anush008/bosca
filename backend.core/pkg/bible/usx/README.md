Bible USX
==

This package contains code for managing Bible data based on the USX format. The standard USX format is defined at [https://ubsicap.github.io/usx/](https://ubsicap.github.io/usx/).

This package is incomplete.  But, it is good enough to process the ASV (because that's what I'm testing with :)).
